# Radogs Radix DLT vanity address generator
Attempts to generate a vanity wallet address with keys or mnemnoic phrase and writes them to .txt files in the current folder. 

**DO NOT SHARE THOSE WITH ANYONE!!!**

## What is the difference between mnemonic and quick mode?
If you plan to use your address with a (hd) wallet like Radix wallet. You will need to use the mnemonic phrase to use this address in your wallet. Quick mode is for developers that for example only require the secret to sign transactions.

## How long will it take to generate my address?
The shorter the lookup word the quicker it will be. We recommend a max of 4-5 characters. Benchmarks will be added here later.

## Work in progress
This is still a work in progress.

Todo list:
- Improve speed for mnemonic mode
- Move some logic out of main.go
- Add more test coverage
