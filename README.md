# Radix DLT vanity address generator
Attempts to generate a Radix mainnet vanity wallet address with keys and outputs them to your console. **DO NOT SHARE THOSE WITH ANYONE!!!**

# How long will it take to generate my address?
Sadly a lot depends on luck, the shorter the lookup word the quicker it will be. Words that are too long might never get generated. Indications might be added here later.

# Work in progress
This is still a work in progress. 

Todo list:
- Don't stop until all addresses are generated
- Create a config
- Move logic out of main.go
- Add tests

# How to use
Simply run main.go and hope for the best ;-)
